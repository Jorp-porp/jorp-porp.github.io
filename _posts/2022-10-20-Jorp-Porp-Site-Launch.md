Aye, I've done it. I've set sail into the vast blue and endless horizon. Now begins my 
long journey into the world of programming. If you want to get technical, I started 
with 'Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python' through MIT openware
on 9/29/22. As of 10/19, I finished the first problem set, which was a dive into flow
control, functions, and just getting a grasp on basic syntax. Slow but steady is my plan.
You can see this view this first set by navigating to my homepage and clicking 'projects'.
